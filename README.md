# Morbad Scorepad

This is a support app for the massively awesome **DUNGEON DEGENERATES:
HAND OF DOOM** boardgame; if you don't know what that is, you're in the
wrong place.  *(Like, in **life**.)*

The only completely functional part of this app is the skill browser,
which shows the fronts & backs of the available skills for a given
adventurer.  (Originally, I started writing this to record games in
progress, but it turns out that taking photos of the board & characters
is pretty easy.)  If everyone at the table has a device with the app,
then no one has to sit around waiting for someone to finish looking at
the skill deck.

For notes on checking out & building the code, see
[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Note that this contains massive amounts of graphics & text which **are
not mine;** it's all owned by GOBLINKO.

### Interesting Features

* In **Settings**, you can turn on & off which expansions you have; that
  will control which adventurers, skills, etc. are shown.
