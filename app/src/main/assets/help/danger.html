<h1>Danger Deck</h1>

<p>This saves the state of the Danger deck, so if you're in the middle of a
    game, exit the app, and start it back up a week later, your deck should be
    just how you left it.</p>

<h2>Drawing cards</h2>

<p>There are two ways to draw a danger card:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The main <b>draw button</b>, which is what you would normally use for
        the first party's danger card draw.</li>
    <li>The <b>"Draw Secondary" button</b>, which is what you would use for
        parties other than the first, and when you need to draw a danger card
        for Void Travel, the Fortune Cards item, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The differences are that the "Draw Secondary" button doesn't shuffle the deck
    on "RESHUFFLE DANGER DECK" cards, doesn't play sound, and doesn't enable the
    "Map Updated" button (see below).</p>

<h2>Undo!</h2>

<p>If you shuffle the deck when you're not supposed to, <b>that's fine;</b> you
    can fix it by hitting "Undo," which will put the draw and discard piles back
    in their previous order.</p>

<p>If you draw a card when you're not supposed to, <b>that's fine;</b> you can
    fix it by hitting "Undo," which will put the card back on the deck.  That
    will enable the "Shuffle Draw Pile" button, which will shuffle the remaining
    cards without affecting the discards.</p>

<p>If you screw <i>that</i> up, you can hit Undo again, and it will restore the
    draw pile to its previous order.</p>

<p>If you refuse to accept Fate, I suppose you <i>could,</i> upon drawing a card
    you don't like, hit Undo, hit Shuffle Draw Pile, and draw again.</p>

<h2>Confirming map changes</h2>

<p>If you're the kind of person who forgets to lower the danger level on the map
    after winning a fight, you can go into Settings and turn on "Confirm
    updates."  Then, when you press the "Draw" button, it will be disabled until
    you press the "Map Updated" button.  (The only point of the "Map Updated"
    button is to keep you from accidentally drawing a new Danger card without
    remembering to update post-fight danger levels.)</p>

<h2>Sound</h2>

<p>By default, the incomplete "Rusty" set of card readings is enabled.  If you
    don't love the sound of Rusty's voice as much as certain people who think
    it's funny to refer to themselves in the third person, you can turn this off
    in Settings.</p>

<p>You can also play a card's sound by tapping it, even if you have Danger Card
sounds turned off.</p>

<h2>You can add your own recordings of you reading the cards!</h2>
