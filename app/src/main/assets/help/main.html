<p>This is a fan-made support app for the massively awesome <b>DUNGEON
DEGENERATES: HAND OF DOOM</b> boardgame, available
<a href="https://goblinkomegamall.com/collections/dungeon-degenerates">here</a>;
see also <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/210232">BoardGameGeek</a>
for rules questions etc.

<h2>Choose your expansions!</h2>

<p>First, open Settings (the wrench-button-thing) and select the expansions
you're  using; this will determine which adventurers, cards, etc. are
available.</p>

<h2>Skill List</h2>

<p>Choose your adventurer; then only the list of skills they can use will be
    shown, and you can see both sides of each skill card at once.  If everyone
    at the table <!-- or, technically, *almost* everyone --> has a device with
    the app, then no one has to sit around waiting for someone to finish looking
    at the skill deck.</p>

<h2>Danger Deck</h2>

<p>This keeps track of the Danger deck, so you never have to shuffle it
    yourself.  More <a href="danger.html">here</a>!</p>

<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>If you'd like to make improvements, the source code is on GitHub at
<a href="https://github.com/kuhrusty/MorbadScorepad/">https://github.com/kuhrusty/MorbadScorepad/</a>.
You can also file bugs there in the issue tracker if things aren't working.</p>
