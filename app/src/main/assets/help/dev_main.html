<h2>Hello developer!</h2>

<p>The non-developer main help page is <a href="main.html">here</a>.  The rest
of this is incomplete documentation for incomplete features.</p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="save">Saving a game</a></h2>

<p>When you're entering Town & Danger levels, if a location doesn't have a
number token, you don't need to enter the number printed on the map; just enter
the tokens which are on the board.</p>

<h3>Saving draw &amp; discard states</h3>

<p>If you're only playing one campaign at a time, then you don't need to worry
about this.  (That is, if you can arrange the cards so that your face-down draw
piles are stacked on top of their face-up discard piles, and have them still be
that way the next time you play so that you can just pull them out of the box
&amp; put them back the way they were, then you don't need the app to record
which cards were in your discard piles.)</p>

<p>However, if you're running more than one campaign at a time&mdash;playing
with one group on Friday night, and another group on Saturday night&mdash;and
you want to preserve your discard piles, you can do that with a little extra
work.</p>

<p><b>First,</b> turn on "Save discard piles" in <b>Settings.</b>  This will
show you the list of decks at the bottom of the campaign record sheet, and you
can click on them to bring up the list of cards in the deck.</p>

<p><b>Next,</b> have another player run through the cards in the discards,
reading off their names, while you find them in the app's alphabetically sorted
list and mark them as discarded.</p>

<h2><a name="restore">Restoring a saved game</a></h2>

<p>There are two ways to go here.  One is to run through the sheet OH GOD WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE DOCUMENTATION</p>

<h2><a name="edit">Editing a saved game</a></h2>

<p>You probably never actually want to do this.  The exception is if you realize
you forgot to record a token or whatever; in that case, use the <b>Edit</b>
button to go back and update the saved campaign.  But, in general, you probably
want to choose <b>Save</b>, pick the point in the campaign you want to copy
from, and go from there.</p>
